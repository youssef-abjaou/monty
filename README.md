**Resources**

	* Google
	* How do I use extern to share variables between source files in C?
	* Working with submodules

**Requirements**

    * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    * All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    * Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    * All your files should end with a new line
    * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    * Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    * You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
    * No more than 5 functions per file
    * You are allowed to use the C standard library
    * The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
    * Don’t forget to push your header file
    * All your header files should be include guarded
    * You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project
    * The repository monty should be added as a submodule to your
    holbertonschool-low_level_programming repository, under the name 0x18-stacks_queues_lifo_fifo

**Git submodules**
      * Git allows you to include other Git repositories called submodules into
       a repository.
      * Submodules allow you to keep projects in separate repositories but still
      be able to reference them as folders in the working directory of other
      repositories.

**The Monty Language**

      * Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty
      byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific
      instructions to manipulate it.
      the goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

**Monty byte code files**

	* Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most
	of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the
	specification of the language.

**LIFO and FIFO**

      * FIFO - First in, First out. A method for organising and manipulating a
      data buffer.
      * LIFO - Last in, First out. The order in which elements come off a stack.

**Stacks and Queues**

      * Stacks - Storing elements in LIFO Style, data area or buffer used for
      storing requests that need to be handled.
      * Queues - Storing elements in FIFO style, and contains elements in
      precisely the order they were added

**push, pall, pint, pop, swap, add, nop**

	* push - The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.
	* pall - The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting
	from the top of the stack.
	* pint - The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack,
	followed by a new line.
	* pop -  The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.
	* swap - The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.
	* add - The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.
	* nop - The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.
	* sub - The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the
	second top element of the stack.
	* div - The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by
	the top element of the stack.
	* mul - The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack
	with the top element of the stack.
	* mod - The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second
	top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.
	* comments - When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat
	this line as a comment (don’t do anything).
	* pchar - The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack,
	followed by a new line.
	* pstr -  The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the
	stack, followed by a new line.
	* rotl - The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.
	* rotr - The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.
	* stack - The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). 
	This is the default behavior of the program.
	* queue - The opcode queue sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).
